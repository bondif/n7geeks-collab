# N7Geeks-collab   

This repository was created in this workshop : https://www.facebook.com/events/941403796218246/ in which I tried to share my experience using Git.
We've also discovered ways to collaborate using Git/Github.   
Big thanks to everyone who created their first Pull Request in this repo.
